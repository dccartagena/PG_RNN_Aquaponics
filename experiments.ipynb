    "Implementation of physics-guided recurrent neural networks (PG-RNN) as architecture to forecast relevant variables in Aquaponics. The main advantage of this architecture is the inclusion of theory-based knowledge into deep learning models as a constraint optimization formulation. The resulting PGNN model will be used in a model-based reinforcement learning framework.\n",
